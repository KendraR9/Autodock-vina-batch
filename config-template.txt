# This is a template config file. This file indicates the path to the receptor and ligand that will be docked.
# The paths where your output and log files will be saved are also included. This allows Vina to run batches of
# docking assays in an orderly manner.

# NOTE: For receptor, output and log folderes, write your folder paths and be sure to add the lines: "\template.pdbqt,
# \out-template.pdbqt, and \log-template.pdbqt" so batch-config.py runs as intended.

# The coordinates have to be added manually to each config file due to the receptors' unique geometries. In special cases
# where the same grid box coordinates can be used, you can add them to this template file to save time.
